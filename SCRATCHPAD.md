## Milestones

> Each milestone should represent a user-visible capability, not a technical task.
> Write the acceptance criteria as things a real user could verify, not things only a developer would notice.

### M0 — Project Initialization

- [ ] Clone template repository
- [ ] Fill in CLAUDE.md project identity section
- [ ] Define milestones M1–M3 below
- [ ] Push initial commit to GitHub
- [ ] Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
- [ ] Confirm live URL is accessible

### M1 — Exhaustive Scholarship Research

The user can see hundreds or thousands of scholarships available that are filterable by a dozen or so different factors including amount of scholarship, deadline, qualifications, restrictions, location, and likelihood of receiving the scholarship, among others.

**Learning-orientation check**:
- [ ] Deepens understanding (not just displays information)
- [ ] Invites participation (asks something of the user)
- [ ] Supports human agency (increases capability, not dependence)

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Searchability of large scholarship database
- [ ] Sorting and Filtering capabilities for each scholarship
- [ ] Large selection of metadata for each scholarship that allows for ease of use of the searching tools

### M2 — AI Prompt Template Generator

The user can select any scholarship and generate an AI prompt suitible for use in a modern AI agent/chat interface that will help with the development of answers to the specific scholarship form/questions. This feature should be very specific in that it creates guardrails for the applicant to use with AI so that all responses require singificant thought and co-creation before submitting materials for any given scholarship.

**Learning-orientation check**:
- [ ] Deepens understanding
- [ ] Invites participation
- [ ] Supports human agency

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Ability to adjust prompts based upon user preferences
- [ ] Understanding of what each application requires (questions, essays, information, etc.)
- [ ] Intuitive guardrails so that the applicant learns something about themselves as they are constructing responses to the scholarship applications

### M3 — Robust Interface and Branding

The user is able to intuitively use the search and support service within a modern look and feel that could easily be seen by someone who uses TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Youtube, or other modern websites as something worth their time. The goal is not to simply have a table of information in the way that other college websites might display opportunities, but rather for each opportunity to look and feel like an "object" that is to be interacted with in the same way that a user might interact with a "post or video" on Instagram or a User within a social network.

**Learning-orientation check**:
- [ ] Deepens understanding
- [ ] Invites participation
- [ ] Supports human agency

**Acceptance criteria**:
- [ ] Look and feel is consistent with modern social networks and websites
- [ ] Each scholarship is an object with robust metadata and can be interacted with as such
- [ ] All "fields" about the scholarship are well maintained and look inviting to a young audience.

<!-- Add milestones as the project grows. Keep acceptance criteria user-observable. -->
