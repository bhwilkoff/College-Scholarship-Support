Mark the current milestone complete and update project state.

When this command is invoked, do the following in order:

1. **Identify the milestone** being completed. If not specified in the command arguments, ask which milestone number (e.g., M1, M2).

2. **Run the learning-orientation check** by asking yourself — and reporting your assessment — for each criterion:
   - Did the features in this milestone deepen user understanding? (not just display information)
   - Did they invite participation rather than passive consumption?
   - Did they increase human agency rather than dependence?

   If any criterion is not met, note it explicitly. Do not fail the milestone — surface the concern and log it.

3. **Update SCRATCHPAD.md**:
   - Mark the milestone's acceptance criteria checkboxes as complete (`- [x]`)
   - Mark the learning-orientation checkboxes for the milestone
   - Update the "Current State" block at the top:
     - Change Active Milestone to the next milestone
     - Update Next Actions with the first 2–3 tasks of the next milestone
     - Clear resolved Open Questions
     - Set Last Session to today's date
   - Append a brief Session Log entry at the bottom of the file

4. **Confirm completion** with a one-line summary: which milestone was completed, what it enables for the user, and what comes next.
