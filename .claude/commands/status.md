Report the current state of the project in a brief, structured summary.

Read CLAUDE.md, SCRATCHPAD.md, and DECISIONS.md, then output:

**[App Name] — Status**

- **Active milestone**: [M# — Name]
- **Overall progress**: [X of Y milestones complete]
- **Last session**: [date from SCRATCHPAD Current State]
- **Next actions**: [bullet list from SCRATCHPAD Current State]
- **Open questions**: [bullet list from SCRATCHPAD Current State, or "none"]
- **Recent decision**: [title and one-line summary of most recent DECISIONS.md entry]

Keep the output short — this is a quick orientation, not a full review. Do not read or summarize the entire session log.
